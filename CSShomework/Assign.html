<p>My most important career advice for women is to learn how to write a resume that will make you competitive in today's market. After all, there is certainly a lot of career advice for women out there – and some of the news is good. </p>


<p>Women are represented in the workforce in greater numbers than ever and holding a higher percentage of managerial and executive jobs than in the past. There are a lot more women-owned businesses than in the past</p>
<p>For women who are looking to advance their careers, following these ten tips is a step in the right direction.</p>
